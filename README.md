# DC Motor Speed PID Controller
The PID controller (Proportional Integral Derivative) controls physical systems to
maintain system's state at the desired value. In this project, we explore PID design and
implementation for a popular yellow DC motor (a.k.a. TT motor), commonly used in
robotics.
The goal is to create an automatic motor speed controller.
